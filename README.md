# JV-Analysis
Small analysis of EQE data. Task is given in 6-EQE.pdf

To generate plots run `python plot.py`. If the plot is shown or saved can be controlled via the `show_figure` variable at the top of the file. 

In order to just calculate the relevant data points run `python main.py`. Results will be printed on the terminal.
